Linux udev rule file for device Logitech F710 gamepad

On the gamepad, put the D â†” X switch into the X position ("XInput Mode").

You can test the gamepad using jstest or jstest-gtk.
You can test force-feedback (rumble, vibration) using fftest.
The "vibration" gamepad button toggles force-feedback, independently from PC.

To figure out the correct name for any device, first plug the controller in and notice which 
/dev/input/event* device is created.

Supposing it is on /dev/input/event7, the following command can be run:

udevadm info -a -n /dev/input/event7

This will print out a lot of information, but only the first two entries are interesting.
Find the line that says ATTRS{name}, and copy the value from there into the file called
99-logitech-f710.rules.
Then rename the SYMLINK to whatever you want.
Copy that file into /etc/udev/rules.d/99-logitech-f710.rules.

Run: udevadm control --reload-rules

Now unplug and replug your device, and the symlink you've chosen should show up in /dev.

To see the complete button/axis map, use: jscal -q /dev/input/event*

Other diagnostic spells:
udevadm monitor # plug/unplug
udevadm monitor -a | grep -A20 event*
